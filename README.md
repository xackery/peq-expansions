# PEQ-Expansions

As a server owner, please use this listing before enabling an expansion to review any modifications you might wish or need to have on your server.

*recommended*: Start at 0, increase by each expansion applying fixes and reviewing changes you may want to apply until you end up at the expansion you plan to release with.


*terms you should know*:
* **soft nerf**: once applied, only future drops of the item will be nerfed. Any past items will stay unnerfed. A classic example of this is the Circlet of Shadow vs Circlet of Shadows, where the prenerf version remained instant cast when the patch was applied to give it a cast time with the plural form.
* **hard nerf**: once applied, both future drops of the item and existing drops will have the nerf applied.
